An alternative link targeting navigation system that combines mouse and keyboard use for minimal cursor travel.

Instructions
------------
Currently this is very experimental. The index.html page can be loaded locally so you can test with. Once loaded, hold down the 'Command' key on a Mac to trigger the mode. Then move your cursor while holding the key in order to reach the links desired.

I also added a bookmarklet link. However, you'll need to host the file somewhere.

The goal is to make this into a proper Chrome Extension, so the code has proper access over web sites in order to make it work (bookmarklets run into all kinds of security restrictions).
